# Hangman

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses before the player who knows the word creates a stick figure of a hanged man by drawing one line for each incorrect guess.
